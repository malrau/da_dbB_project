    "Import of a csv file in MySQL can be performed by a <code>LOAD DATA</code> statement. The file to be imported must be specified after the <code>INFILE</code> keyword, while the table name where the data will be copied must be specified after the <code>INTO TABLE</code> keywords. So, the basic structure of a <code>LOAD DATA</code> statement is as follows:\n",

    "<h4>Optional clauses</h4><br>\n",
    "- <code>FIELDS</code> and <code>LINES</code><br>\n",
    "It is also useful to include some optional keywords in the statement, providing the DBMS information on how the data is organised into the csv file. These may refer to <code>FIELDS</code> (<code>TERMINATED BY</code> and <code>ENCLOSED BY</code>) or <code>LINES</code> (<code>TERMINATED BY</code>) and are used to tell the DBMS, in order:\n",
    "\n",
    " - how fields (columns, attributes) are separated by one another (by commas '<i>,</i>' in the following case);\n",
    " - that characters within double quotes must not be considered as separators ('<i>\"</i>'). Since the data contained in each field are not necessarily enclosed within double quotes (they usually are when there is a comma that does not separate fields), the keyword <code>OPTIONALLY</code> is also used;\n",
    " - to perform a new insertion (insert a new row) when meeting the special character indicating a new line ('<i>\\n</i>'):\n",

    "</code>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- <code>IGNORE</code><br>\n",
    "By specifying to <code>IGNORE 1 ROWS</code> we declare that the first row of the csv file must not be inserted into the table (we imply, usually, that it contains the attribute names of the table).<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- <code>LOCAL</code><br>\n",
    "Finally, it is to be considered that 'mycsvfile.csv' is expected to be located on the server host. If it is not the case (we want to load a text file located on the client host) the keyword <code>LOCAL</code> must be specified immediately after <code>LOAD DATA</code>.<br> The complete statement to import a csv file into MySQL is then as follows:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<code>\n",

    "    LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n'\n",
    "    IGNORE 1 ROWS;\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<h4>A note on the use of <code>LOCAL</code>:</h4><br>\n",
    "Since there are potential security implications within the process of transferring a file from the client to the server (these are specified <a href = 'https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data-local-security.html'>here</a> and consist either in the theoretical possibility for a server to gain access to any part of the file system to which the client has access or in the possibility, in a web environment, that a user connected to the web server is allowed to read any files that the web server has read access to), the use of <code>LOCAL</code> may return an error if the client host and the server host are not configured appropriately.<br>For example, if I run MySQL from a Docker container, select a database and create a table with a schema matching the header of the csv file, I can run and perform the afore mentioned <code>LOAD DATA</code> statement, and be returned the error:<br><code>ERROR 3948 (42000): Loading local data is disabled; this must be enabled on both the client and server sides</code>. For control over local data loading, MySQL permits this capability to be enabled or disabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the <b>server level</b>, the capability is controlled by the global system variable <code>local_infile</code>. So, to check if it is enabled at the server level, a <code>SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES</code> statement can be performed:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile'\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually set to <i>OFF</i>, so a <code>SET GLOBAL</code> statement on the aforementioned variable would allow us to change it to <i>ON</i>:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    SET GLOBAL local_infile = True\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the <b>client level</b>, it is sufficient to start MySQL with the option <code>local_infile=1</code> to enable the capability:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    mysql --local_infile=1 -uroot -p\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<h4>Notes when running MySQL from a Docker container:</h4><br>\n",
    "A couple of further notes are required when running MySQL within a Docker container. Since a Docker container has its own file system, MySQL cannot access parts of the file system not mounted to the container. In particular, the csv file cannot be loaded by MySQL from outside the container. Hence it has to be copied to the container with the <code>docker cp</code> command. This command allows either to copy a file from the container to the local machine or the reverse (which is what we want here). We need to simply pass the source path and file name and the destination path. In our case it would be:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    docker cp <i>path/mycsvfile.csv</i> <i>container:/path</i>\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "where <i>container</i> is the container name. To put the file in the root folder of the container one can simply type <code><i>container:/</i></code> as destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I want to load the csv file from within a SQL script. This script is organised in a <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement and a <code>LOAD DATA</code> statement (it is advised to also indicate the database where to create the table, or to create it as well). The table creation specifies a schema that matches exactly the first row of the csv file, which contains the table header. The import statement specifies the csv file name and it optionally indicates its path. Actually, I copied the csv files (the four differently sized files) directly into the container, without specifying any container subfolder, hence I would simply indicate the file name in single quotes after the <code>LOCAL INFILE</code> clause of the <code>LOAD DATA</code> statement. Exactly as it is shown in the above templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final consideration regards the execution of an external script from a MySQL instance run from within a container. As the <a href = 'https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql'>MySQL Docker Hub</a> web page points out under the paragraph <i>Restoring data from dump files</i>, MySQL must be executed from the container together with the indication of the script that we want to be executed:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    docker exec -i <i>container</i> mysql --local_infile=1 -uroot -p[PASSWORD] &#60; <i>path/myscript.sql</i>\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the use of the option <code>local_infile=1</code> when starting the server to enable file loading at the client level. Previously, after starting the MySQL container, we must have set the <code>local_infile</code> global variable on as previously specified. Also notice that this procedure does not allow us to input the password interactively. It must be provided when running the <code>docker exec</code> command from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "After successful execution of the script we are returned to the system folder from which we have run the <code>docker exec</code> command. By entering MySQL again we can check if the scripted actions have been actually performed on the MySQL server.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<h4>Recap and summarize:</h4><br>\n",
    "To recap and summarize, the procedure to import a csv file on MySQL requires us to perform the following actions, in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- start the MySQL container;\n",
    "- copy the csv file into the container (<code>docker cp</code>);\n",
    "- login to MySQL and set the global variable <code>local_infile</code> to ON;\n",
    "- logout from MySQL;\n",
    "- call the SQL script containing the <code>LOAD DATA</code> statement while accessing to the MySQL server with the <code>docker exec</code> command;\n",
    "- login to MySQL and check if the script execution has obtained the required results.\n"
