Indexing the line array gives us access to a specific field value. For example, if each line of our csv file contains the attributes of various entities, entities can be abstracted from their attributes and created as labeled nodes, and their attributes can be considered as node properties. If the schema is known and rigid, it is possible to know the attributes of each entity within the data: indexing the line array, thus, allows to distribute the properties to the nodes we create from abstracting the entities.\n",

    "According to the above presentation, a few more considerations need to be done on the actual implementaion we need to perform.<br>First of all, it is advised to separate node and relationship creation into separate processing: this way the load is only doing one piece of the import at a time and can move through large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, reducing heavy processing.<br>Moreover, we have to take into account the presence of null values in some of the learning material names. Null values are not stored by Neo4j (a property either exists or it doesn't and in the latter case it doesn't need to be created. When importing a flat csv file, the presence of null values causes import failure, so it must be handled some way. The option I chose is not perhaps the most adherent to the logic of a graph database, but nonetheless it prevents dropping a property which is mandatory in my schema, and it works for this case: it consists in the use of the <code>coalesce()</code> function on the <i>materialName</i> property. <code>coalesce()</code> allows to display a fallback default value when a property doesn’t exist on a node or relationship: I set this default value to '<i>empty</i>'.\n",
