This repository hosts the project for the exam of the course Database - Module B from the Data Analysis degree of the University of Messina. The project consists in building a dataset simulating data from an online learning platform allowing students to access course materials, take quizzes and submit assignments. The dataset should contain simulated information on the above listed kinds of actions performed by hypothetical students.
The simulated data should be contained in 4 csv files of increasing size (250k, 500k, 750k and 1m records), and imported into 5 different DBMS, i.e.: MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis and Neo4j).
For each of the dataset equivalent (in the desired output) queries must be performed in order to register each DBMS response time with each dataset size. Results must be plotted and a report must be created, presenting the obtained results.
I plan to manage the DBMS by using the Python programming language.
